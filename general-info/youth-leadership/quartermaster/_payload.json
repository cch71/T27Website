SCOUTING will teach you how to care for and nurture the land and its animals.  SCOUTING promises you the joy of friendship, both through old friends you have known for years and new friends you have yet to meet.  SCOUTING gives you the opportunity to work toward the Eagle Scout Rank. You will learn to set goals for yourself, map a course to achieve them and follow through to success.  SCOUTING promises you experiences and responsibilities that will help you mature into a strong, wise adult.",{"id":24,"path":25,"dir":19,"title":26,"description":7,"keywords":27,"body":28},"content:2.about:2.troop-philosophy.md","/about/troop-philosophy","Troop Philosophy",[],"    Troop Philosophy  Troop 27 operates on the simple philosophy that Boy Scouts are having the most fun when hiking, exploring, and challenging themselves. To this end, we feel that lightweight camping has become a lost art. Too much emphasis has been placed on bringing creature comforts and lots of support gear. Many great troops operate this way although several trucks and trailers are required to move the troop from point to point. Cooking and cleaning soon occupy two hours per meal and, when added up, a significant portion of your time in the outdoors is wasted. Our Scouts carry their own food and gear, cook on lightweight stoves, and backpack into the campsite even if we have the ability to drive in. By doing this, the Scout learns to bring only what he needs and to pack light. At the campsite, this translates into less gear to keep track of, less gear to clean, and more time to enjoy the outdoors. Scouts in Troop 27 are constantly improving their outdoor skills through experience.  Troop 27 maintains very little camping gear (water purifier, shovel, flag, etc.) because it is expected the scout will acquire the necessary gear over time through gifts and fundraising and eventually have a complete set of camping gear he can use even after leaving scouts.  Troop 27 Purpose: (as developed by the seven parents and scouts who started the troop back in 2002!)    To be a high speed, low drag troop.   Carry everything you need on your back!  Respect for adults  Respect for each other and always be willing to help each other  Respect for the American flag and traditions  Respect for your uniform – always worn properly with SHIRTS always tucked in  \"Yes sir,  Yes mam!\"  Always use with adults, not just during troop functions  Be proud to be a scout with ultimate goal of attaining Eagle Scout rank and have fun too!  Pay your own way to summer camp through troop & personal fund raising  Summer camp out of the Texas summer heat!  Meet on Sunday twice a month to help encourage a well rounded boy in sports, band, choir or any other school activity.  Prioritize and keep all in balance and still keep up with your school grades.  Above all, have fun and learn as much as you can!",{"id":30,"path":31,"dir":19,"title":32,"description":7,"keywords":33,"body":34},"content:2.about:3.meetings.md","/about/meetings","Meetings",[],"    Meetings     Troop Meetings    Where:\tThe Pavilion at Saint John Vianney Catholic Church.

At age 13 1/2, young people may begin working toward an award by establishing goals and registering with the National Office. Participants may earn several levels of recognition including Bronze, Silver and Gold certificates as well as Bronze, Silver and Gold Medals. This is an excellent opportunity for young people in Scouting and Venturing to use their activities to earn a rather unique series of awards.  To earn an award, young people must establish goals and carry out activities related to volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness and an expedition or exploration outside their normal environment. Each award level is cumulative, i.e., time spent on one award is carried forward to the next level.  Many Scouting activities may be used to earn an award. High adventure trips could be used to complete the expedition requirement. Earning merit badges could be used to help satisfy personal development and/or physical fitness. Time spent in a major position of leadership in a troop or crew could count toward the volunteer public service, as could time spent during troop and crew service projects.  \n    .awards {\n        display: inline-block;\n        vertical-align: top;\n        padding-right: 5rem;\n    }\n    .awards li {\n          list-style-type: none;\n    }\n",{"id":62,"path":63,"dir":64,"title":65,"description":7,"keywords":66,"body":68},"content:3.policy:1.joining-and-annual-rechartering.md","/policy/joining-and-annual-rechartering","policy","Joining And Annual Rechartering",[67],"To become a registered Boy Scout or Adult Leader with Troop 27 do the following:","    Joining and Annual Rechartering   Register Online     Click here for a new parent information form.

Learning to manage money is one of the ways Scouting prepares young men for life. Earning and budgeting money to accomplish goals helps develop self-reliance and the skills of personal finance management. Although funds raised through troop fundraising activities belong to the unit, these funds can be utilized to reduce the cost of participation and provide financial assistance to individual Scouts based upon their level of participation in specific activities benefiting Troop 27.  These Troop 27 “Scout Accounts” are designed to help make Scouting affordable by offsetting the costs associated with participation in the Troop 27 program. A Scout can use these funds to pay for such expenses as registration and activity fees, uniforms, training classes, and camping costs throughout the Scout’s adventures with Troop 27. Allocations are credited towards the Scout account if the Scout choses to participate in Troop 27 fundraisers. Scouts can use this money to purchase Scout-related gear and camping fees with Troop 27. The Troop Committee has absolute discretion as to whether any particular expenditure is eligible for reimbursement solely based on whether it benefits Troop 27 or a Scout’s participation in Troop 27 Activities. All funds raised belong to the Troop and may not be transferred to the Scout or another unit. When the Scout is no longer active in the Troop or turns 18, they are returned to the general funds.  It is important to note that all revenue generated from Troop 27 fundraising activities can be used ONLY for Troop 27 activities and related expenses. All eligible expenses will need to be purchased by the Scout and then the original receipts must be turned in to the treasurer in order to receive reimbursement from the Scout account. Listed below is how Scouts can use the money allocated in their Scout accounts.

At troop meetings, patrol meetings, campouts, and at home you learn and practice skills\nthat are required for advancement. (As Scouts develop knowledge and skills, they are asked to teach\nothers and, in this way, they learn and develop leadership.)  You are TESTED.   Once you feel that you have mastered a skill, you ask your Patrol Leader to test you.  He either passes\nyou on the requirement or advises you that additional learning is needed.  (Make sure your Patrol Leader\nsigns off on the requirement at the back of your book.)  When all requirements except those signed off by adult leaders are met you sign up to rank advance at the next campout.   Requirements signed off on by adult leaders:\n   Scout Spirit  Service Hours  Cyber Chip  Participation  Troop Activities  Position of Responsibility  Scoutmaster Conference  Board of Review  At the campout, you approach the Advancement Chair for sign offs on things like Service Hours, Participation, Troop Activities, & Position of Responsibility  Then you ask the Advancement Chair to schedule a Scoutmaster Conference.  The Advancement Chair will arrange a time for you to meet with a Scoutmaster during that campout.  Be sure to be in uniform (e.g. bring a pen, watch, rope, & compass, and have the proper current rank patch on your uniform, and also a good idea to bring a camp chair)   You are REVIEWED.   For ranks above Scout, when you have completed all the requirements for a rank except the Board of Review, you meet with a Board of Review made up of troop committee members. The board makes sure you’ve completed all the requirements and also talks with you about your Scouting experience.   You are RECOGNIZED.   As soon as possible, you are recognized for your advancement at a troop meeting where you receive your badge. (You’ll later be recognized again at a special ceremony called a Court of Honor.)  Notes:   Scoutmaster Conferences and Board of Reviews are held on campouts although exceptions can be arranged.  To sign up for Rank Advancement, use the Campout sign up link and indicate you would like to Rank Advance at that upcoming Campout.  This must be done before the Thursday prior to the campout to give the adult leaders time to pull and verify your records (i.e. Service Hours).  For the purposes of advancement, “showing scout spirit” is determined by the Scoutmaster.  In order for the Scoutmaster to know if you are showing scout spirit you need to be present at activities.  This means attending at least 50% of the meetings and 50% of the outings during the advancement period prior to the Scout’s Board of Review date for a given rank (usually the six months preceding the Scoutmaster Conference).  The Scout handbook is the master record of the Scout’s achievements, if lost, some information may never be recovered. The Troop records are for administrative purposes only. It is the responsibility of the Scout to ensure the accuracy of all records as they pertain to him.  Troop 27 holds a Court of Honor two times a year to recognize those Scouts that have advanced in rank, earned merit badges, or any other awards. These are family events and all are invited.

Process  As per BSA guidelines Troop 27 uses the blue card system for Merit Badges. When a scout wishes to start working on a Merit Badge, he should follow this process:   Scout decides he wants to work on a merit badge.  Scout goes to the Advancement Chair and tells him what merit badge he wants to work on and requests a signed blue card and a counselor.  Advancement Chair looks up which adults have signed up to be a merit badge counselor for the specific merit badge and assigns a counselor to the scout.  Scout talks with the counselor and commences work on the merit badge.  As work progresses, the scout shows his completed work and discusses items with his counselor.  Upon completion, the counselor keeps one part of the blue card for his record. The counselor signs the scout's copy and gives the other two parts of the blue card back to the scout. The scout gets the Advancement Chair to sign the completed card. The scout keeps one part for his record and turns in the third part to the Advancement Chair so that so that the badge gets awarded.  Badge is awarded at the next court of honor.  Merit Badge Library  The troop also maintains a merit badge library made from donated books. After completing a merit badge feel free to donate your book so that others may benefit. See our troop Librarian for a complete list of titles available.

The boys themselves hold positions of leadership, develop the program, and carry out projects and activities. They also have the responsibility to establish codes of behavior based on the principles of the Scout Oath and Law. When a troop member oversteps the boundaries of that code, it is up to the members of the Patrol Leaders Council to let the boy know “We don’t do that here” or “That is not acceptable behavior for a Scout”. Serious or recurring negative activity might require the involvement of the Scoutmaster and other adult leaders in a firm, fair manner. Instances of cheating, lying, inappropriate language, vandalism, or fighting is unacceptable in our troop.  A boy who continually disrupts meetings or whose actions endanger himself or others during scouting activities will be sent home. Discipline problems that may result in the boy’s permanent removal from the troop will be handled by the Scoutmaster and the troop committee and will always involve the boy’s parents or guardian.

Vision Statement  The Boy Scouts of America is the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training.  In the future Scouting will continue to   Offer young people responsible fun and adventure;  Instill in young people lifetime values and develop in them ethical character as expressed in the Scout Oath and Law;  Train young people in citizenship, service, and leadership;  Serve America's communities and families with its quality, values-based program.  Boy Scout Program Membership  Boy Scouting, one of the traditional membership divisions of the BSA, is available to boys who have earned the Arrow of Light Award or have completed the fifth grade, or who are 11 through 17 years old . The program achieves the BSA's objectives of developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities among youth by focusing on a vigorous program of outdoor activities.  Boy Scout program membership, as of December 31, 2001, is  Volunteer Scouters  Thousands of volunteer leaders, both men and women, are involved in the Boy Scouting program. They serve in a variety of jobs—everything from unit leaders to chairmen of troop committees, committee members, merit badge counselors, and chartered organization representatives.  Like other phases of the program, Boy Scouting is made available to community organizations having similar interests and goals. Chartered organizations include professional organizations; governmental bodies; and religious, educational, civic, fraternal, business, labor, and citizens' groups. Each organization appoints one of its members as the chartered organization representative. The organization is responsible for leadership, the meeting place, and support for troop activities.  Who Pays for It?  Several groups are responsible for supporting Boy Scouting: the boy and his parents, the troop, the chartered organization, and the community. Boys are encouraged to earn money whenever possible to pay their own expenses, and they also contribute dues to their troop treasuries to pay for budgeted items. Troops obtain additional income by working on approved money-earning projects. The community, including parents, supports Scouting through the United Way, Friends of Scouting campaigns, bequests, and special contributions to the BSA local council. This income provides leadership training, outdoor programs, council service centers and other facilities, and professional service for units.  Aims and Methods of the Scouting Program  The Scouting program has three specific objectives, commonly referred to as the \"Aims of Scouting.\" They are character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness.  The methods by which the aims are achieved are listed below in random order to emphasize the equal importance of each.  Ideals  The ideals of Boy Scouting are spelled out in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Scout motto, and the Scout slogan. The Boy Scout measures himself against these ideals and continually tries to improve. The goals are high, and as he reaches for them, he has some control over what and who he becomes.  Patrols  The patrol method gives Boy Scouts an experience in group living and participating citizenship. It places responsibility on young shoulders and teaches boys how to accept it. The patrol method allows Scouts to interact in small groups where members can easily relate to each other. These small groups determine troop activities through elected representatives.  Outdoor Programs  Boy Scouting is designed to take place outdoors. It is in the outdoor setting that Scouts share responsibilities and learn to live with one another. In the outdoors the skills and activities practiced at troop meetings come alive with purpose. Being close to nature helps Boy Scouts gain an appreciation for the beauty of the world around us. The outdoors is the laboratory in which Boy Scouts learn ecology and practice conservation of nature's resources.  Advancement  Boy Scouting provides a series of surmountable obstacles and steps in overcoming them through the advancement method. The Boy Scout plans his advancement and progresses at his own pace as he meets each challenge. The Boy Scout is rewarded for each achievement, which helps him gain self-confidence. The steps in the advancement system help a Boy Scout grow in self-reliance and in the ability to help others.  Associations With Adults  Boys learn a great deal by watching how adults conduct themselves. Scout leaders can be positive role models for the members of the troop. In many cases a Scoutmaster who is willing to listen to boys, encourage them, and take a sincere interest in them can make a profound difference in their lives.  Personal Growth  As Boy Scouts plan their activities and progress toward their goals, they experience personal growth. The Good Turn concept is a major part of the personal growth method of Boy Scouting. Boys grow as they participate in community service projects and do Good Turns for others. Probably no device is as successful in developing a basis for personal growth as the daily Good Turn. The religious emblems program also is a large part of the personal growth method. Frequent personal conferences with his Scoutmaster help each Boy Scout to determine his growth toward Scouting's aims.  Leadership Development  The Boy Scout program encourages boys to learn and practice leadership skills. Every Boy Scout has the opportunity to participate in both shared and total leadership situations. Understanding the concepts of leadership helps a boy accept the leadership role of others and guides him toward the citizenship aim of Scouting.  Uniform  The uniform makes the Boy Scout troop visible as a force for good and creates a positive youth image in the community. Boy Scouting is an action program, and wearing the uniform is an action that shows each Boy Scout's commitment to the aims and purposes of Scouting. The uniform gives the Boy Scout identity in a world brotherhood of youth who believe in the same ideals. The uniform is practical attire for Boy Scout activities and provides a way for Boy Scouts to wear the badges that show what they have accomplished.  Outdoor Activities  Local councils operate and maintain Scout camps. The National Council operates high-adventure areas at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, the Northern Tier National High Adventure Program in Minnesota and Canada, and the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in the Florida Keys . About 70 councils also operate high-adventure programs.  The BSA conducts a national Scout jamboree every four years and participates in world Scout jamborees (also held at four-year intervals). Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, was the site of the 2001 National Scout Jamboree.  The Beginning of Scouting  Scouting, as known to millions of youth and adults, evolved during the early 1900s through the efforts of several men dedicated to bettering youth. These pioneers of the program conceived outdoor activities that developed skills in young boys and gave them a sense of enjoyment, fellowship, and a code of conduct for everyday living.  In this country and abroad at the turn of the century, it was thought that children needed certain kinds of education that the schools couldn't or didn't provide. This led to the formation of a variety of youth groups, many with the word \"Scout\" in their names. For example, Ernest Thompson Seton, an American naturalist, artist, writer, and lecturer, originated a group called the Woodcraft Indians and in 1902 wrote a guidebook for boys in his organization called the Birch Bark Roll. Meanwhile in Britain, Robert Baden-Powell, after returning to his country a hero following military service in Africa, found boys reading the manual he had written for his regiment on stalking and survival in the wild. Gathering ideas from Seton, America 's Daniel Carter Beard, and other Scoutcraft experts, Baden-Powell rewrote his manual as a nonmilitary skill book, which he titled Scouting for Boys. The book rapidly gained a wide readership in England and soon became popular in the United States . In 1907, when Baden-Powell held the first campout for Scouts on Brownsea Island off the coast of England, troops were spontaneously springing up in America .  William D. Boyce, a Chicago publisher, incorporated the Boy Scouts of America in 1910 after meeting with Baden-Powell. (Boyce was inspired to meet with the British founder by an unknown Scout who led him out of a dense London fog and refused to take a tip for doing a Good Turn.) Immediately after its incorporation, the BSA was assisted by officers of the YMCA in organizing a task force to help community organizations start and maintain a high-quality Scouting program. Those efforts climaxed in the organization of the nation's first Scout camp at Lake George, New York, directed by Ernest Thompson Seton. Beard, who had established another youth group, the Sons of Daniel Boone (which he later merged with the BSA), provided assistance. Also on hand for this historic event was James E. West, a lawyer and an advocate of children's rights, who later would become the first professional Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America. Seton became the first volunteer national Chief Scout, and Beard, the first national Scout Commissioner.  Publications  The BSA publishes the Boy Scout Handbook (more than 37 million copies of which have been printed); the Patrol Leader Handbook, which offers information relevant to boy leadership; the Scoutmaster Handbook; more than 100 merit badge pamphlets dealing with hobbies, vocations, and advanced Scoutcraft; and program features and various kinds of training, administrative, and organizational manuals for adult volunteer leaders and Boy Scouts. In addition, the BSA publishes Boys' Life magazine, the national magazine for all boys (magazine circulation is more than 1.3 million) and Scouting magazine for volunteers, which has a circulation of 900,000.  Conservation  Conservation activities supplement the program of Boy Scout advancement, summer camp, and outdoor activities and teaches young people to better understand their interdependence with the environment.",{"id":191,"path":192,"dir":193,"title":194,"description":7,"keywords":195,"body":199},"content:4.general-info:2.youth-leadership:1.overview.md","/general-info/youth-leadership/overview","youth-leadership","Overview",[196,197,198],"Elections","Patrol Leaders Council","Positions","    Youth Leadership  Elections  Elections are held twice a year in August and February.
