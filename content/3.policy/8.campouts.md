### Costs

Troop 27 pays for monthly campout campsites if funds allow. If the troop does not have sufficient funds to cover monthly campout costs, then the participants will be required to pay. At this time, the fundraising activities have covered campouts without issue. Scouts are required to to pay for extra activities such as horseback riding or other special activities. The troop will collect the appropriate fees at the troop meeting prior to the campout or at the campout departure.   

### Transportation

For the monthly campouts the troop does not provide transportation between the church and campgrounds.  Usually we have enough volunteers that your scout can carpool with.  However we do that each scout family is required to provide round trip transportation to at least 2 campouts per year.  So that we can judge if we need to ask for volunteer drivers please make sure to sign up for the monthly campouts at this troop website.
