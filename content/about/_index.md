> Troop 27 operates on the simple philosophy that Boy Scouts are having the most
> fun when hiking, exploring, and challenging themselves. To this end, we feel that
> lightweight camping has become a lost art. Too much emphasis has been placed on
> bringing creature comforts and lots of support gear. Many great troops operate this
> way although several trucks and trailers are required to move the troop from point
> to point. Cooking and cleaning soon occupy two hours per meal and, when added up,
> a significant portion of your time in the outdoors is wasted. Our Scouts carry their
> own food and gear, cook on lightweight stoves, and backpack into the campsite even
> if we have the ability to drive in. By doing this, the Scout learns to bring only
> what he needs and to pack light. At the campsite, this translates into less gear
> to keep track of, less gear to clean, and more time to enjoy the outdoors.
> Scouts in Troop 27 are constantly improving their outdoor skills through experience.
>
> Troop 27 maintains very little camping gear (water purifier, shovel, flag, etc.) because
> it is expected the scout will acquire the necessary gear over time through gifts and
> fundraising and eventually have a complete set of camping gear he can use even after
> leaving scouts.
