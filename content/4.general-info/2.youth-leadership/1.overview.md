### Elections

Elections are held twice a year in August and February. In order to run for and hold an office in the troop, scouts must maintain their attendance at 50% of meetings and 50% of outings. If a scout falls below 50% and is not able to perform the duties of his office, the Scoutmaster will give one warning. If attendance does not improve, the scout may be removed from office.

### Patrol Leaders Council

The PLC, not the adult leaders, is responsible for planning and conducting the troopâ€™s activities. 
The PLC is composed of the following voting members: Senior Patrol Leader, Assistant Senior Patrol 
Leader(s), Patrol Leaders and Troop Guide. At its monthly meetings, the PLC organizes and assigns
activity responsibilities for weekly troop meetings. The troop committee interacts with the PLC 
through the Scoutmaster.
