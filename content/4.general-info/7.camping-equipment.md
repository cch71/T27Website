Camping Equipment List
::

There are various gear lists available in your scout book, online, and from retailers such as Academy, REI, etc. Because of our mobile (backpacking) philosophy, weight and size should be factored into product selection. Keep it small and light. Pack your backpack with weight distribution in mind and adjust the pack for fit. Avoid hanging too many things on the outside of the pack. These things can get hung up or beat up in travel or when hiking.

There are some activities which might require personal gear specific to the activity which is not included below (e.g. trekking poles, canoeing gloves, dry bag).
