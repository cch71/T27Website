Troop Philosophy
::

Troop 27 operates on the simple philosophy that Boy Scouts are having the most fun when hiking, exploring, and challenging themselves. To this end, we feel that lightweight camping has become a lost art. Too much emphasis has been placed on bringing creature comforts and lots of support gear. Many great troops operate this way although several trucks and trailers are required to move the troop from point to point. Cooking and cleaning soon occupy two hours per meal and, when added up, a significant portion of your time in the outdoors is wasted. Our Scouts carry their own food and gear, cook on lightweight stoves, and backpack into the campsite even if we have the ability to drive in. By doing this, the Scout learns to bring only what he needs and to pack light. At the campsite, this translates into less gear to keep track of, less gear to clean, and more time to enjoy the outdoors. Scouts in Troop 27 are constantly improving their outdoor skills through experience.

Troop 27 maintains very little camping gear (water purifier, shovel, flag, etc.) because it is expected the scout will acquire the necessary gear over time through gifts and fundraising and eventually have a complete set of camping gear he can use even after leaving scouts. 

Troop 27 Purpose: (as developed by the seven parents and scouts who started the troop back in 2002!)
