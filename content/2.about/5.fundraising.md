Fundraising
::

The main source of funding for the troop is two annual fundraising projects.   The fall wreath and centerpiece sale begins in the early part of November. The spring mulch sale begins in the early part of February.   Each scout is expected to participate. The proceeds of the sales are used to financially support the troop and assist scouts in paying for troop activities. See [Financial Policy](/policies-and-procedures/financial-policy) for more information. Any suggestions you have for fundraising can be directed to the fundraising chairman on the troop committee.

For the holidays, Troop 27 sells Christmas wreaths as a fundraiser.  It is a great opportunity to alleviate costs for Winter Camp, Summer Camp, and/or High Adventure Camps.  See the Financial Policy Page for more information.
