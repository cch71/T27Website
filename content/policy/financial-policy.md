## Financial Assistance Policy BSA Troop 27

A Scout is thrifty. Learning to manage money is one of the ways Scouting prepares young men for life.
Earning and budgeting money to accomplish goals helps develop self-reliance and the skills of personal
finance management. Although funds raised through troop fundraising activities belong to the unit,
these funds can be utilized to reduce the cost of participation and provide financial assistance to
individual Scouts based upon their level of participation in specific activities benefiting Troop 27.

### Scout Accounts

The Troop 27 “Scout Accounts” are designed to help make Scouting affordable by offsetting the
costs associated with participation in the Troop 27 program. A Scout can use these funds to pay for
such expenses as registration and activity fees, uniforms, training classes, and camping costs
throughout the Scout's adventures with Troop 27. Allocations are credited towards the Scout account
if the Scout chooses to participate in Troop 27 fundraisers. Scouts can use this money to purchase
Scout-related gear and camping fees with Troop 27. The Troop Committee has absolute discretion as
to whether any particular expenditure is eligible for reimbursement solely based on whether it
benefits Troop 27 or a Scout's participation in Troop 27 Activities. All funds raised belong to the
Troop and may not be transferred to the Scout or another unit. When the Scout is no longer active
in the Troop or turns 18, they are returned to the general funds.

It is important to note that all revenue generated from Troop 27 fundraising activities can be
used ONLY for Troop 27 activities and related expenses. All eligible expenses will need to be
purchased by the Scout and then the original receipts must be turned in to the treasurer in order
to receive reimbursement from the Scout account. Listed below is how Scouts can use the money allocated
in their Scout accounts.

### Scout Accounts can be used for

- Camping expenses, including fees for campsites, summer & winter camp fees, and High Adventure Camp costs.
- Travel costs associated with Troop 27 camping activities.
- Camping gear used on a routine basis (e.g. tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, Nalgene bottles, flashlights, etc.)
- BSA Uniform & Troop 27 class B (e.g. caps, shirts, pants, boots, yellow shirts, etc.)
- Expenses associated with merit-badge classes
- Rechartering fees
- Court of Honor Meal Cost
- Training Classes (e.g. NYLT)
- Scout’s Eagle Court of Honor Banquet expenses

**_Scout Account allocations CANNOT be:_**

- used for Eagle projects
- transferred to another Scout unit
- used for specialty gear used 1-2 times per year. (e.g. canoes, bikes, firearms, etc.)

### Refund Policy

Troop 27 recognizes that unexpected situations can arise that prevent Scouts or adult participants
from attending activities they have already paid for. This includes cases where the troop determines
that a Scout or adult is not eligible to attend a specific event. Our policy is to refund expenses
only when those costs have not yet been paid to vendors on behalf of the participant. If activity
funds have already been used for non-refundable expenses—such as camp reservations, airline tickets,
or other advance payments—the troop will be unable to provide a refund. Many of these expenditures
must be made well in advance and are typically non-refundable. We encourage participants to notify
the troop leadership as soon as possible if they cannot attend a scheduled event, so that any potential
refunds can be pursued before payments are finalized.
