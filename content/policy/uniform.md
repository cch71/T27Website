In Troop 27, we hold the wearing of the uniform in the highest regard. It is a
reflection of the Scout, the Troop, and Boy Scouts of America, in general.
Therefore, we place great emphasis on wearing the uniform with pride.

_Although the initial investment in a Scout uniform may seem expensive,
the uniform is rugged and the Scout will usually outgrow it before it wears out.
When buying uniforms keep growth in mind._
