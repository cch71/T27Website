### Process

As per BSA guidelines Troop 27 uses the blue card system for Merit Badges. When a scout
wishes to start working on a Merit Badge, he should follow this process:

1. Scout decides he wants to work on a merit badge.
2. Scout goes to the Advancement Chair and tells him what merit badge he wants to
   work on and requests a signed blue card and a counselor.
3. Advancement Chair looks up which adults have signed up to be a merit badge counselor
   for the specific merit badge and assigns a counselor to the scout.
4. Scout talks with the counselor and commences work on the merit badge.
5. As work progresses, the scout shows his completed work and discusses items with his counselor.
6. Upon completion, the counselor keeps one part of the blue card for his record. The
   counselor signs the scout's copy and gives the other two parts of the blue card back
   to the scout. The scout gets the Advancement Chair to sign the completed card. The scout
   keeps one part for his record and turns in the third part to the Advancement Chair so that
   so that the badge gets awarded.
7. Badge is awarded at the next court of honor.

### Merit Badge Library

The troop also maintains a merit badge library made from donated books. After
completing a merit badge feel free to donate your book so that others may benefit.
See our troop Librarian for a complete list of titles available. The requirements
in the merit badge books are the official requirements to earn the badge. Other
resources include:
