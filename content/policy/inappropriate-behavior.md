Successful Scouting is built upon the boy-led troop and the boy-led patrol. The
boys themselves hold positions of leadership, develop the program, and carry out
projects and activities. They also have the responsibility to establish codes of
behavior based on the principles of the Scout Oath and Law. When a troop member
oversteps the boundaries of that code, it is up to the members of the Patrol Leaders
Council to let the boy know “We don’t do that here” or “That is not acceptable
behavior for a Scout”. Serious or recurring negative activity might require the
involvement of the Scoutmaster and other adult leaders in a firm, fair manner.
Instances of cheating, lying, inappropriate language, vandalism, or fighting is
unacceptable in our troop.

A boy who continually disrupts meetings or whose actions endanger himself or others
during scouting activities will be sent home. Discipline problems that may result in
the boy’s permanent removal from the troop will be handled by the Scoutmaster and the
troop committee and will always involve the boy’s parents or guardian.

> Three Strikes

> - **Strike 1:** The patrol has done all they can; Scoutmaster must act (Scout/Parents informed).
> - **Strike 2:** Scoutmaster must act to correct behavior again (Scout/Parents/Committee
>   informed) Parent must accompany Scout to any further functions.
> - **Strike 3:** Scoutmaster/Committee agree to permanent removal of the scout from the troop (Parents/Scout informed).

**_Our goal is never to have to use this system but we also don’t want to spend 95% of our time on 5% of our
scouts (the ones who misbehave). It’s not fair to the scouts who are onboard with the scouting program._**
