The boys themselves hold positions of leadership, develop the program, and carry out projects and activities. They also have the responsibility to establish codes of behavior based on the principles of the Scout Oath and Law. When a troop member oversteps the boundaries of that code, it is up to the members of the Patrol Leaders Council to let the boy know “We don’t do that here” or “That is not acceptable behavior for a Scout”. Serious or recurring negative activity might require the involvement of the Scoutmaster and other adult leaders in a firm, fair manner. Instances of cheating, lying, inappropriate language, vandalism, or fighting is unacceptable in our troop."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A boy who continually disrupts meetings or whose actions endanger himself or others during scouting activities will be sent home.
