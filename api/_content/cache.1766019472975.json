Many great troops operate this way although several trucks and trailers are required to move the troop from point to point. Cooking and cleaning soon occupy two hours per meal and, when added up, a significant portion of your time in the outdoors is wasted. Our Scouts carry their own food and gear, cook on lightweight stoves, and backpack into the campsite even if we have the ability to drive in. By doing this, the Scout learns to bring only what he needs and to pack light. At the campsite, this translates into less gear to keep track of, less gear to clean, and more time to enjoy the outdoors.

Meanwhile in Britain, Robert Baden-Powell, after returning to his country a hero following military service in Africa, found boys reading the manual he had written for his regiment on stalking and survival in the wild. Gathering ideas from Seton, America 's Daniel Carter Beard, and other Scoutcraft experts, Baden-Powell rewrote his manual as a nonmilitary skill book, which he titled Scouting for Boys.

Immediately after its incorporation, the BSA was assisted by officers of the YMCA in organizing a task force to help community organizations start and maintain a high-quality Scouting program. Those efforts climaxed in the organization of the nation's first Scout camp at Lake George, New York, directed by Ernest Thompson Seton. Beard, who had established another youth group, the Sons of Daniel Boone (which he later merged with the BSA), provided assistance. Also on hand for this historic event was James E.
